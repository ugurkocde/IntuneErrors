# Error 2016341112: Device Currently Busy

:::danger Error Message
iOS device is currently busy (2016341112)
:::

## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Dec) | `2016341112` |
| Component | `Device Configuration` |
| Platform | `iOS/iPadOS` |
| Status | `NotNow` |

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to deploy a device configuration profile to an iOS device that is in a state where it cannot process the request. Common scenarios include locked devices, devices performing updates, or devices installing applications. The device sends a "NotNow" status to indicate it will retry the operation later.

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîí Device State Issues
Profile deployment failures often stem from device state conditions. Device might be locked. System updates could be in progress. App installations may be ongoing. Understanding device state requirements is crucial for successful profile deployment.

</div>
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± System Activity
System-level activities can prevent profile processing. Background tasks might be running. Resource-intensive operations could be in progress. Device might be in power-saving mode. These system conditions require resolution before profile application.

</div>
</div>

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Device State Verification
Check device status:
1. Verify device is unlocked
2. Ensure no updates are in progress
3. Check for ongoing app installations
4. Monitor device activity

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Profile Redeployment
After device is available:
1. Device will automatically retry
2. Monitor profile status
3. Verify successful application
4. Document deployment completion

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preventive Measures
For future deployments:
1. Schedule during active hours
2. Coordinate with update windows
3. Plan for user interaction
4. Document deployment patterns

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip Profile Deployment
When addressing deployment issues, focus on device availability. Allow time for automatic retries. Verify device state before troubleshooting. Monitor deployment progress. Document successful patterns.
:::

:::warning Platform Behavior
This is normal iOS platform behavior, not an Intune issue. Device will automatically retry when available. Consider this behavior in deployment planning. Monitor for persistent issues.

## Deployment Strategy Guide

1. **State Assessment**
   - Check device status
   - Review activities
   - Monitor availability
   - Document conditions

2. **Timing Planning**
   - Schedule appropriately
   - Consider user patterns
   - Plan for retries
   - Track progress

3. **Success Verification**
   - Monitor deployment
   - Verify application
   - Check compliance
   - Document outcomes

:::tip Best Practice
Allow for automatic retry mechanisms and plan deployments during periods when devices are likely to be unlocked and available for profile application.
