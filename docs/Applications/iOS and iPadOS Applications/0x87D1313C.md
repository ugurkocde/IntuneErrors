## Description

:::info
This error occurs when the network connection is lost while sending the updated download service URL to the device. The specific issue is that the device cannot locate the server with the specified hostname, indicating DNS resolution or network connectivity problems.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì∂ Network Issues
Network connectivity problems can manifest in various ways during app installation. Unstable Wi-Fi connections frequently interrupt the download process, often requiring multiple retry attempts. DNS resolution failures prevent the device from locating necessary installation resources. Network timeouts occur when connection requests exceed system-defined waiting periods. Proxy interference can block or corrupt download attempts, especially in enterprise environments with strict security policies.

### üåê Connection Problems
Connection quality issues significantly impact installation success. Poor signal strength leads to intermittent connectivity and failed downloads. VPN configuration conflicts can prevent proper routing of installation traffic. Network restrictions, particularly in corporate environments, may block access to required resources. Firewall rules might inadvertently prevent necessary communication between the device and installation servers.

## Impact

:::note
- Temporary interruption in app deployment
- Automatic retry on network restoration
- May affect multiple devices on same network
:::

### Connection States
- üö´ **Failed State:**
  - Download service unreachable
  - DNS resolution failed
  - Network interruption
- ‚úÖ **Recovery Action:**
  - Automatic retry mechanism
  - Network verification needed
  - Connection restoration required

### Service Behavior
- üîÑ **Retry Mechanism:**
  - Automatic retry on reconnection
  - Progressive backoff pattern
  - Network status monitoring
- üì° **Connectivity Check:**
  - DNS resolution test
  - Server availability check
  - Network quality assessment

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Network Verification
Begin troubleshooting by conducting a comprehensive network assessment. Start with a thorough Wi-Fi connection analysis, including signal strength and stability measurements. Verify DNS settings through the device's network configuration panel. Conduct extensive network stability testing using various resources. Perform detailed signal strength analysis in different device locations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connection Reset
When network issues persist, implement a systematic connection reset process. Begin by toggling the Wi-Fi connection off and on to establish a fresh connection. If necessary, reset network settings to their default configuration, being mindful of the need to reconfigure custom settings afterward. Clear the device's DNS cache to resolve any resolution issues. Test the connection using an alternate network to isolate device-specific problems.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Service Validation
Conduct thorough service validation to ensure all required endpoints are accessible. Begin by verifying server accessibility through multiple methods. If VPN services are in use, test connectivity both with and without VPN enabled. Attempt connection through different networks to identify any network-specific issues. Implement continuous connection monitoring to detect intermittent problems.
