## Description

:::info
This error occurs when a device has an older version of a managed app installed and fails to update to the latest version. The error may appear temporarily during the normal update process while waiting for the device to report successful installation of the new version. It can also indicate a genuine failure in the update process. The error persists until either the device reports successful installation of the new version or encounters a different error condition.
