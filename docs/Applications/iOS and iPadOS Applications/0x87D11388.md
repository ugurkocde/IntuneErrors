## Description

:::info
This error occurs when an app installation is attempted while the iOS/iPadOS device is in a locked state or busy with other system operations. The device must be unlocked and available for the installation to proceed successfully.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîí Device State
Device state issues frequently prevent successful app installations in iOS/iPadOS environments. When the device is locked, the system's security policies prevent installation processes from executing properly. Screen timeout activation can interrupt ongoing installation procedures, requiring user intervention. Devices in sleep mode may not process installation requests until fully awakened. System updates in progress take priority over app installations, causing temporary unavailability of installation services.

<div class="cause-card">

### üì± System Activity
Background system activities can significantly impact installation capabilities. Resource-intensive background processes may prevent new installations from initiating properly. Low power mode activation restricts certain system functions, including app installations, to conserve battery life. System maintenance tasks, such as background indexing or backup processes, can temporarily block installation attempts. These concurrent activities must complete before new installations can proceed successfully.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Immediate Actions
Address the device's current state by implementing a series of immediate corrective measures. Begin by ensuring the device is fully unlocked and accessible. Wake the device screen and maintain its active state throughout the installation process. Enter the device passcode when prompted to ensure full system access. If active, disable low power mode to ensure full system capabilities are available for the installation process.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ System Preparation
Optimize the device environment to support successful installation. Systematically close unnecessary background applications to free up system resources. Review and if necessary, postpone any pending system updates that might interfere with the installation. Implement measures to free up system resources, ensuring adequate capacity for the installation process. Verify that the device maintains sufficient battery charge to complete the installation without interruption.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Retry
Execute a controlled installation retry process following system optimization. Begin by checking the notification center for any pending installation requests. Carefully initiate the installation process, ensuring all prerequisites are met. Monitor the installation progress to identify any potential issues early in the process. Perform thorough verification of the installation completion to ensure success.

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip For Successful Installation
Ensuring successful app installation requires attention to several key factors. Begin by verifying that the device remains unlocked throughout the process. Maintain an active screen state to prevent installation interruptions. Close unnecessary background applications to optimize resource availability. Disable power-saving features that might interfere with the installation process.
:::

:::warning Common Pitfalls
Several common scenarios can impede successful app installation. Auto-lock settings may prematurely interrupt the installation process if not properly configured. Low power mode activation can restrict necessary installation functions. Concurrent background processes may compete for required system resources. Ongoing system updates can prevent new installations from initiating properly.
