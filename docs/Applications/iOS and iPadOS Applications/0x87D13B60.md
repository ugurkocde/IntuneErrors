## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x87D13B60` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2016330912` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error typically occurs during the deployment of paid iOS App Store applications. When attempting to install a paid app, the system requires a valid redemption code or Volume Purchase Program (VPP) license to complete the installation process. Without proper licensing or redemption codes, the installation remains in a pending state.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üí≥ Licensing Issues
Paid applications from the App Store require proper licensing mechanisms for deployment. This error commonly occurs when attempting to deploy a paid app without associated VPP licenses or redemption codes. Organizations must ensure they have purchased sufficient app licenses through Apple Business Manager or have valid redemption codes before deployment.

</div>
<div class="cause-card">

### üîÑ Deployment Configuration
The deployment configuration may be incomplete or incorrectly set up in Intune. This includes scenarios where VPP token synchronization is pending, license assignment policies are not properly configured, or when there's a mismatch between the app's purchase status and deployment settings. Proper configuration of both Intune and Apple Business Manager is essential for successful deployment.

## Impact

:::note
When this error occurs, it creates a significant impact on app deployment workflows and user productivity. The installation process remains incomplete, preventing users from accessing necessary business applications. This situation requires administrative intervention to resolve licensing issues and ensure proper app availability.
:::

### Deployment States
- üì± **Current State:**
The application remains in a pending installation state, unable to complete the deployment process. Users receive installation prompts but cannot proceed without proper licensing. This creates a frustrating experience for end-users and increases support requests to IT administrators.

- ‚úÖ **Required State:**
A properly licensed state requires valid VPP licensing or redemption codes associated with the app deployment. This includes synchronized VPP tokens, assigned licenses, and correct app purchase verification through Apple Business Manager.

### Business Impact
- üè¢ **Organizational Workflow:**
Business processes dependent on the application may be disrupted until proper licensing is implemented. Users cannot access required functionality, potentially impacting productivity and operational efficiency.

- üìä **License Management:**
Organizations must maintain accurate license inventory and ensure proper distribution of available licenses. This includes monitoring license usage, managing renewals, and planning for additional license purchases as needed.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ License Verification
The first step involves verifying the current licensing status of the application. IT administrators should check Apple Business Manager for available licenses, confirm VPP token synchronization status, and ensure proper license assignment configurations in Intune.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Token Management
Proper VPP token management is crucial for resolution. This includes verifying token validity, ensuring recent synchronization, and confirming token association with the correct app licenses. Administrators should check token expiration dates and refresh tokens if necessary.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Configuration
Review and adjust deployment configurations to ensure proper license assignment. This includes verifying app assignment policies, checking user or device license allocation, and confirming app purchase status in Apple Business Manager.

## License Management Guide

1. **VPP Token Management**
Maintaining healthy VPP token status is crucial for successful app deployment. This includes regular token verification, timely renewal processes, and proper synchronization with Intune. Administrators should monitor token expiration dates and maintain documentation of token relationships with app licenses.

2. **License Inventory Control**
Effective license inventory management ensures continuous app availability. This involves tracking license usage, maintaining adequate license reserves, and implementing processes for license reclamation from inactive users or devices.

3. **Deployment Verification**
Regular verification of deployment configurations helps prevent licensing issues. This includes checking assignment policies, verifying license associations, and monitoring deployment success rates across the organization.

:::tip Best Practice
Implement automated monitoring solutions to track license usage and receive alerts before license depletion affects app deployments.
