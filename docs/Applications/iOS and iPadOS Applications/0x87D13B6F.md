# Error 0x87D13B6F: Intune Connection Timeout

:::danger Error Message
Your connection to Intune timed out.
:::

## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x87D13B6F` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2016330897` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when the device fails to complete app manifest validation due to network connectivity issues, specifically a timeout in the connection to Intune services. The timeout indicates that the connection attempt exceeded the allowed time limit before receiving a response, preventing successful manifest validation and subsequent app installation.

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üåê Network Connectivity Issues
Connection timeouts can stem from various network-related factors. Poor network signal strength or unstable connections may cause delayed responses. Network congestion could extend response times beyond timeout limits. Proxy or firewall configurations might impede timely connections. Understanding network requirements is crucial for preventing timeout issues.

<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Device Communication Factors
Device-specific conditions can contribute to connection timeouts. Background processes might interfere with network resource allocation. Device network settings could affect connection performance. Power management states may impact network capabilities. These device-level factors require systematic investigation for resolution.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Network Assessment
Begin with comprehensive evaluation of network connectivity status. Test network signal strength and stability. Verify network configuration settings on the device. Check for any proxy or firewall restrictions. Document current network conditions and any identified issues.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connection Optimization
Implement measures to improve connection reliability. Connect to stable, high-speed networks when possible. Verify and adjust network timeout settings if applicable. Clear network caches and reset network settings if needed. Document all optimization steps taken.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Retry
Attempt manifest validation after network optimization. Monitor connection response times during retry attempts. Document any changes in timeout behavior. Consider testing on different networks if issues persist. Verify successful manifest validation after resolution.
