## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x87D13B77` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2016330889` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when app manifest validation fails due to an inability to establish a secure (HTTPS) connection. Unlike general connectivity issues, this error specifically indicates a failure in establishing the encrypted connection required for secure communication. This typically involves SSL/TLS negotiation failures or certificate validation issues.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîí Security Protocol Issues
Secure connection failures often stem from SSL/TLS-related problems. Certificate validation errors might prevent secure connections. TLS version mismatches could cause negotiation failures. Security protocol configurations might be incompatible. Understanding security requirements is crucial for establishing secure connections.
