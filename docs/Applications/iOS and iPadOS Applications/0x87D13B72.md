# Error 0x87D13B72: Active Connection Lost

:::danger Error Message
You lost connection to the Internet.
:::

## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x87D13B72` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2016330894` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when an active Internet connection is lost during app manifest validation. Unlike the host resolution error (0x87D13B70), this indicates that an initially established connection was interrupted during the process. This type of connection loss typically occurs mid-operation rather than during initial connection attempts.
