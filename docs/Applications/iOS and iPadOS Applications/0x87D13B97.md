## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to install applications on an iOS/iPadOS device that is currently in Lost Mode.

<div class="cause-card">

### Lost Mode Status
Device security measures automatically prevent app installations when Lost Mode is active. Lost Mode may have been enabled through various scenarios including device theft reporting, security incidents, or administrative actions. The intentional lockdown of device functionality serves as a critical security measure for protecting corporate data and preventing unauthorized modifications. Understanding the implications of Lost Mode activation is essential for proper device management.

### üì± Security State Management
Lost Mode represents a specific device security state that affects multiple device functions. Attempting standard device management actions while in Lost Mode will be restricted or blocked entirely. The security state takes precedence over normal management operations to maintain device protection. Administrative intervention is required to modify the device state before normal operations can resume.
