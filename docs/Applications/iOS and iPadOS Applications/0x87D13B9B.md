# Error 0x87D13B9B: Installation Failed with Sync Retry

:::danger Error Message
The app installation failed. Intune will try again the next time the device syncs.
:::

## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x87D13B9B` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2016330853` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when an app installation fails due to a device-related issue, but the system has determined that a retry attempt during the next sync cycle may resolve the problem. The error indicates a temporary condition that could be resolved through the normal device synchronization process rather than requiring immediate intervention.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîÑ Sync State Issues
Device synchronization states can affect installation success in various ways. Incomplete or outdated sync states might prevent proper installation validation. Policy synchronization delays could affect installation prerequisites. Management state inconsistencies may require a full sync cycle to resolve. Understanding the relationship between sync state and installation success is crucial for troubleshooting.

<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Device State Conditions
Temporary device conditions often contribute to installation failures that can be resolved through synchronization. Resource availability might improve after a sync cycle refreshes system states. Policy applications pending sync completion could affect installation capability. Device management state might need refresh through synchronization. These conditions typically self-resolve through normal sync processes.

</div>

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sync Status Verification
Begin by checking the current device synchronization status and history. Review last successful sync completion time and results. Verify any pending sync actions or policy applications. Document current sync state and any error indicators. Consider the time since last successful synchronization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Sync Initiation
If appropriate, initiate a manual device synchronization to expedite resolution. Launch Company Portal app to trigger manual sync. Monitor sync progress and completion status. Verify successful sync completion before proceeding. Document any sync-related errors encountered.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Sync Validation
After successful synchronization, verify installation retry status. Monitor for automatic installation retry attempts. Check installation status through Intune admin center. Document outcomes of post-sync installation attempts. Consider additional sync cycles if needed.

## Best Practices

<div class="card-container">
<div class="practice-card">

### üë®‚Äçüíª For IT Administrators
Effective sync-dependent error management requires understanding of synchronization patterns. Implement regular monitoring of device sync status and health. Maintain documentation of sync-related installation patterns. Develop clear procedures for managing sync-dependent installations. Create systematic approaches to sync verification and troubleshooting. Consider implementing automated sync monitoring tools.

</div>
<div class="practice-card">

### üîÑ For Sync Management
Successful sync management requires attention to timing and device state. Develop clear understanding of sync cycle impacts on installations. Maintain awareness of policy application dependencies on sync. Implement appropriate sync schedule management. Create documentation of sync-related troubleshooting procedures. Regular sync health monitoring helps prevent installation issues.

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip Sync Management
When dealing with sync-dependent installations, focus on sync health verification. Allow appropriate time for automatic sync cycles. Consider manual sync initiation when appropriate. Monitor sync completion status. Verify policy application after sync completion.
:::

:::warning Important Considerations
Sync-related issues involve several timing factors. Multiple sync cycles may be necessary. Policy application may require additional time. Consider device state impacts on sync. Monitor for recurring sync issues.

## Sync Management Guide

1. **Sync Status Assessment**
   - Check last sync time
   - Review sync history
   - Verify pending actions
   - Document sync state

2. **Sync Process Management**
   - Consider manual sync
   - Monitor sync progress
   - Verify completion
   - Check policy application

3. **Installation Verification**
   - Monitor retry attempts
   - Check installation status
   - Verify app functionality
   - Document outcomes

:::tip Best Practice
Maintain awareness of device sync patterns and their impact on installation processes, allowing appropriate time for automatic retry mechanisms while monitoring for successful resolution.
