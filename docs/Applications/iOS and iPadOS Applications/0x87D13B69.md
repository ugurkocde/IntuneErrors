## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to apply device-based VPP licensing to a device running an iOS/iPadOS version earlier than 9.0. Device-based VPP licensing is a feature introduced in iOS 9.0 and requires this minimum version or higher to function. The only resolution is to upgrade affected devices to a supported iOS/iPadOS version.

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Version Incompatibility
Operating system version requirements prevent VPP licensing on older devices. Legacy iOS versions lack necessary device-based licensing capabilities. Version constraints are a fundamental platform limitation. Devices running pre-iOS 9.0 versions cannot utilize device-based VPP licensing features. Understanding version requirements is crucial for proper license deployment planning.

### üîÑ Upgrade Management Issues
Version management challenges can affect licensing compatibility. Devices may remain on unsupported iOS versions due to various constraints. Upgrade processes might be delayed or incomplete. Some devices may be incapable of upgrading to supported versions. Clear upgrade management procedures are essential for maintaining licensing compatibility.
