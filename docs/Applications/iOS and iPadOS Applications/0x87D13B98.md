## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to install applications on an iOS/iPadOS device that is configured in kiosk mode. Kiosk mode is a restricted operational state that limits device functionality to specific approved applications. The installation restriction is an intentional security measure to maintain the controlled environment of kiosk mode.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîí Kiosk Mode Configuration
Kiosk mode implementations naturally restrict app installation capabilities to maintain environment integrity. Configuration policies define strict application availability and prevent unauthorized additions. The controlled environment ensures consistent user experience and security compliance. Understanding kiosk mode restrictions is crucial for proper device management and application deployment planning.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Policy Configuration Issues
Policy assignments may create unintended restrictions for devices requiring app installations. Kiosk mode configuration policies might inadvertently include devices that need deployment flexibility. Exclusion groups may not be properly configured to allow necessary app installations. Clear understanding of policy impact and exclusion management is essential for successful app deployment.

</div>

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration Review
Begin with a comprehensive review of kiosk mode configuration policies affecting the device. Identify all active policies and their assignment scope. Verify whether the device requires exclusion from kiosk mode restrictions. Document current configuration state and required changes for implementation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exclusion Group Management
Create or modify exclusion groups to enable necessary app installations. Add affected devices to appropriate exclusion groups. Verify exclusion group assignments and policy application. Monitor policy synchronization to ensure changes take effect. Document all group management actions for future reference.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Policy Verification
Implement systematic verification of policy changes and their effects. Monitor device state changes after exclusion group modifications. Verify successful removal of kiosk mode restrictions where intended. Test app installation capabilities after policy updates. Document verification process and outcomes.

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip Configuration Management
When managing kiosk mode restrictions, follow systematic policy modification procedures. Review all affected configuration policies before making changes. Document current state and planned modifications. Test policy changes in controlled environments. Monitor policy application and synchronization status.
:::

:::warning Common Pitfalls
Policy management involves several potential complications. Exclusion group changes may require time to propagate. Multiple policies might affect device state. Consider timing factors in policy updates. Monitor for unintended consequences of policy modifications.
