:::info

<div class="cause-card">

### üìä License Pool Exhaustion
License availability issues arise from various resource management scenarios. All purchased licenses have been assigned to active users or devices. Growth in deployment scope may exceed available license quantity. Automatic assignment policies might consume licenses faster than anticipated. Understanding license pool management is crucial for preventing deployment interruptions.

### üîÑ License Management Issues
Inefficient license management practices can lead to premature pool exhaustion. Licenses may remain assigned to inactive users or decommissioned devices. Incomplete license reclamation processes could prevent reuse of available licenses. Assignment policies might not efficiently distribute limited license resources. Regular license pool maintenance is essential for optimal resource utilization.
