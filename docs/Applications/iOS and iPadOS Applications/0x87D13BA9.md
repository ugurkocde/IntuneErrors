## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to deploy a VPP app with device-based licensing to a BYOD device enrolled through Apple User Enrollment. User Enrollment only supports user-based licensing for VPP apps, requiring either a licensing type change or separate assignment configuration.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Enrollment Type Mismatch
The fundamental issue often stems from enrollment configuration incompatibilities. BYOD devices utilizing User Enrollment have specific licensing requirements that differ from corporate-owned devices. When device-based licensing is attempted on these user-enrolled devices, the system enforces strict security boundaries that prevent installation. Account-driven enrollment scenarios require specific licensing configurations that align with Apple's management framework. These unsupported configurations create barriers between the intended deployment and actual device capabilities.

<div class="cause-card">

### üîë License Assignment Issues
License management complexities frequently contribute to deployment failures. Incorrect license type assignments often result from misunderstanding the relationship between enrollment types and licensing requirements. Mixed deployment targets can create conflicts when attempting to apply a single licensing strategy across diverse device management scenarios. Assignment configuration errors may occur during the initial setup or subsequent modifications of app deployment policies. VPP token mismatches between the intended license type and actual device enrollment state can prevent successful app installation.

## Impact

:::note
- App installation blocked
- BYOD deployments affected
- User Enrollment limitations
- Assignment reconfiguration needed
:::

### Enrollment Context
- üö´ **Unsupported Configuration:**
  - Device licensing blocked
  - User Enrollment restrictions
  - BYOD limitations
- ‚úÖ **Supported Configuration:**
  - User-based licensing
  - Personal device management
  - User-centric deployment

### Deployment Scenarios
- üì≤ **BYOD Devices:**
  - User Enrollment required
  - Personal device management
  - Limited management scope
- üè¢ **Corporate Devices:**
  - Supervised enrollment
  - Full device management
  - All licensing types supported

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enrollment Verification
Begin with a comprehensive assessment of the device's enrollment status. Thoroughly examine the current enrollment type through the Intune portal and device settings. Confirm the User Enrollment status by reviewing the management profile details. Review the device status to understand its current management scope and limitations. Identify any management restrictions that might affect app deployment capabilities.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ License Configuration
Address licensing configuration to align with enrollment requirements. Modify existing app assignments to utilize user-based licensing for User Enrolled devices. Create separate assignment groups based on enrollment types to prevent licensing conflicts. Ensure target groups accurately reflect the intended deployment scope and licensing model. Verify that all configuration changes align with organizational security policies.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Validation
Implement a systematic validation process for the updated configuration. Test the modified deployment settings with a pilot group before broader implementation. Monitor the installation process to ensure proper license application. Verify successful app installation and functionality under the new licensing model. Document any issues or anomalies for future reference and process improvement.

<div class="practice-card">

### üë®‚Äçüíª For IT Administrators
Successful management of User Enrollment scenarios requires careful planning and ongoing oversight. Develop comprehensive enrollment strategies that account for different device ownership models. Maintain separate deployment configurations for BYOD and corporate devices to prevent licensing conflicts. Implement thorough documentation practices for all licensing decisions and configurations. Regular monitoring of deployment success rates helps identify potential issues before they impact users. Establish clear policies regarding device enrollment types and corresponding app licensing requirements.

<div class="practice-card">

### üîÑ For Deployment Management
Effective deployment management requires attention to both technical and organizational aspects. Implement appropriate licensing models based on careful analysis of enrollment scenarios. Maintain clear separation between different enrollment types in deployment configurations. Conduct regular reviews of configuration settings to ensure continued alignment with requirements. Test deployment scenarios thoroughly before implementing changes in production environments. Monitor and document deployment patterns to optimize future configurations.

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip License Configuration
Successful license management requires systematic verification and configuration processes. Begin by thoroughly reviewing the current enrollment type and its implications. Carefully examine all licensing settings to ensure alignment with enrollment requirements. Verify all assignments to confirm proper targeting and configuration. Conduct thorough testing with representative sample groups before full deployment.
:::

:::warning Common Pitfalls
Organizations should be aware of several critical challenges in managing User Enrollment scenarios. Mixed licensing types can create confusion and deployment failures if not properly managed. Incorrect assumptions about enrollment types often lead to misconfiguration of licensing settings. Unsegmented assignments may cause conflicts between different device management models. Proper enrollment verification is essential before making licensing changes.
