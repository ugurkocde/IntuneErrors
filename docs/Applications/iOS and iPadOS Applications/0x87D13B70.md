## Description

:::info
This error occurs when app manifest validation fails due to complete loss of Internet connectivity, specifically when the device cannot locate the host server. Unlike a timeout error, this indicates a more fundamental network connectivity issue where the device has no active Internet connection or cannot resolve the necessary network addresses.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üåê Network Availability Issues
Complete connection loss can occur due to various infrastructure factors. Network service interruptions may prevent any connectivity. Wi-Fi or cellular data services might be disabled or malfunctioning. DNS resolution failures could prevent host location. Understanding the various levels of network failure helps guide troubleshooting efforts.
