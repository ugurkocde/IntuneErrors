# Error 0x87D1041C: App Detection Failure

:::danger Error Message
The application was not detected after installation completed successfully.
:::

## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x87D1041C` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2016345060` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when the app installation process completes successfully, but subsequent detection mechanisms fail to confirm the app's presence on the device. The discrepancy between the installation status and device response indicates a potential mismatch in app detection criteria or device reporting mechanisms.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Detection Mechanism Issues
App detection challenges can arise from various system-level complications. Detection criteria might not match the actual app installation parameters, leading to false negative reports. System inventory updates may lag behind actual installation status, causing temporary detection failures. App bundle identifier mismatches between deployment configuration and actual installation can trigger detection errors. The complexity of iOS/iPadOS app management sometimes results in delayed or incorrect detection reporting.

<div class="cause-card">

### üîÑ System State Discrepancies
System state reporting can encounter various synchronization issues affecting app detection. Device inventory updates might not process immediately after installation completion. Management agent communication delays can result in temporary detection failures. System caching mechanisms might retain outdated app status information. These timing and state management issues often require specific remediation steps for resolution.

</div>

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Verification
Begin the troubleshooting process with a thorough verification of the actual installation state. Physically verify the app's presence on the device through visual inspection of the home screen or app library. Check the iOS/iPadOS Settings app for the installed application's presence. Review installation logs for successful completion indicators. Compare the installed app's bundle identifier with deployment configuration specifications.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Detection Refresh
Implement steps to refresh the device's app detection mechanisms. Initiate a device sync to trigger fresh inventory reporting. Force close and restart the Company Portal or management agent if present. Clear relevant caches that might contain outdated app status information. Allow sufficient time for detection processes to complete their cycles.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration Review
Conduct a comprehensive review of app detection configurations. Verify that app detection criteria match the deployed application specifications. Review deployment configuration for accurate bundle identifier information. Check for any version-specific detection requirements. Ensure all required app attributes are properly configured in the deployment settings.

<div class="practice-card">

### üë®‚Äçüíª For IT Administrators
Effective app detection management requires proactive monitoring and configuration practices. Implement comprehensive app detection criteria that account for various installation scenarios. Maintain detailed documentation of successful detection configurations for reference. Regularly review and update detection methods based on deployment experiences. Establish clear procedures for troubleshooting detection failures. Monitor detection success rates to identify potential systematic issues.

</div>
<div class="practice-card">

### üîÑ For Deployment Management
Successful deployment management requires attention to detection configuration details. Implement thorough testing of detection criteria before broad deployment. Maintain consistent app configuration standards across deployment groups. Regular validation of detection mechanisms helps prevent false reporting. Document common detection issues and their resolutions for future reference. Consider implementing automated detection validation processes.

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip Detection Verification
When troubleshooting detection issues, follow a systematic verification process. Begin with visual confirmation of the app's installation status. Verify app bundle identifiers match deployment configurations. Allow sufficient time for system inventory updates. Document any discrepancies between observed and reported states.
:::

:::warning Common Challenges
Detection issues can manifest in various ways requiring careful analysis. System reporting delays may cause temporary detection failures. Bundle identifier mismatches often lead to persistent detection issues. Cache-related problems might require system refresh actions. Consider timing factors in detection processes.
