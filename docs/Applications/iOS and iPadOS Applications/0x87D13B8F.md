## Description

:::info
This error occurs specifically with Line of Business (LOB) applications when the app is present on the device but was installed outside of Intune management. To establish proper management control, the unmanaged version must be removed, allowing Intune to deploy and manage its version during the next device sync cycle.

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Installation Source Conflict
Management conflicts arise from unauthorized installation sources. Users might install apps directly from development sources or alternative distribution methods. Pre-existing app installations from before device enrollment can cause management gaps. Manual installations bypass Intune's management framework. Understanding proper LOB app deployment channels is crucial for maintaining management control.

<div class="cause-card">

### üîÑ Management State Issues
App management state inconsistencies prevent proper Intune control. Previously installed versions lack necessary management profiles. Direct installations don't receive management policies. Incomplete enrollment processes might affect app management status. Clear understanding of management requirements helps prevent installation conflicts.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ App Removal
Implement controlled removal of the unmanaged application version. Guide users through proper app uninstallation process. Verify complete removal of app and associated data. Document removal process and any user data backup requirements. Ensure no residual app components remain.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Managed Deployment
Allow Intune to deploy the managed version through normal sync processes. Initiate device sync after app removal if needed. Monitor deployment status through Intune admin center. Verify successful installation and proper management state. Document successful deployment for future reference.
