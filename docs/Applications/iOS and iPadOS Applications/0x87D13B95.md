## Description

:::info
This error occurs when Intune cannot locate or validate a Volume Purchase Program (VPP) license for an app deployment. The issue typically indicates a license assignment problem, synchronization issue, or license availability constraint. Resolution often requires license management intervention through revocation and reassignment processes.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîë License Assignment Issues
License management complications frequently lead to assignment failures. License assignments may become corrupted or desynchronized between systems. Previous failed deployments might leave licenses in an inconsistent state. Token synchronization problems can prevent proper license validation. The complexity of VPP license management often requires careful attention to assignment processes and states.

<div class="cause-card">

### üì± System State Discrepancies
System-level inconsistencies can affect license validation and assignment. Synchronization delays between Apple Business Manager and Intune may cause temporary license unavailability. Cache-related issues might prevent proper license detection. License pool status might not accurately reflect in deployment systems. These state management issues often require systematic troubleshooting approaches.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ License Verification
Begin with a comprehensive assessment of the current license state. Check license availability in Apple Business Manager for the specific application. Verify VPP token synchronization status with Intune. Review existing license assignments and their current states. Document any discrepancies found during the verification process.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ License Revocation
Implement a controlled license revocation process when verification indicates issues. Navigate to the app license management section in Intune. Identify affected user or device assignments. Execute license revocation for problematic assignments. Allow sufficient time for revocation processes to complete and synchronize.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ License Reassignment
Proceed with systematic license reassignment after successful revocation. Ensure clean license state before initiating new assignments. Implement assignments according to organizational policies and requirements. Monitor assignment process for successful completion. Verify proper license activation after reassignment.
