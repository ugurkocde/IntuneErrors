## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to deploy a non-VPP application to a Shared iPad environment. Apple's Shared iPad functionality requires all applications to be obtained through the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) to ensure proper licensing and management across multiple users. This restriction is a fundamental requirement of the Shared iPad architecture.

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Deployment Configuration Issues
Deployment misconfigurations often arise from incomplete understanding of Shared iPad requirements. Attempting to deploy standard App Store applications without VPP licensing triggers this error. Configuration settings might not properly identify the target devices as Shared iPads. Deployment targeting may inadvertently include both standard and Shared iPad devices. Understanding the distinct requirements for Shared iPad deployments is crucial for successful app management.

<div class="cause-card">

### üîë Licensing and VPP Management
VPP-related issues frequently contribute to deployment failures in Shared iPad environments. Missing or incorrect VPP licensing for required applications prevents successful deployment. Token synchronization problems between Apple Business Manager and Intune can affect license availability. Improper VPP token configuration may prevent proper license assignment. Clear understanding of VPP management for Shared iPad scenarios is essential.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ VPP Configuration
Begin by ensuring proper VPP setup for the application deployment. Access Apple Business Manager to verify app purchase and licensing through VPP. Confirm VPP token synchronization status with Intune. Review license quantity and availability for Shared iPad deployment. Ensure all necessary permissions and configurations are in place for VPP app distribution.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Verification
Conduct thorough verification of deployment configuration settings. Review device targeting to confirm proper identification of Shared iPad devices. Check app assignment settings to ensure VPP license association. Verify deployment inclusion/exclusion rules are correctly configured. Document all configuration settings for future reference.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ License Management
Implement proper license management procedures for Shared iPad deployments. Allocate sufficient VPP licenses for the Shared iPad environment. Monitor license usage and availability across deployed devices. Establish clear procedures for license reallocation and management. Maintain accurate records of license assignments and usage patterns.
