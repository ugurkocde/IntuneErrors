# Error 0x87D13B9C: 32-bit App Not Supported

:::danger Error Message
Can't install 32-bit apps on this device.

## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to deploy a 32-bit application to a modern iOS/iPadOS device. Starting with iOS 11, Apple discontinued support for 32-bit applications, requiring all apps to be 64-bit compatible. This represents a fundamental architectural limitation that cannot be circumvented through management tools or configurations.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üì± Architecture Incompatibility
Modern iOS/iPadOS devices exclusively support 64-bit applications due to hardware and operating system requirements. Attempts to deploy legacy 32-bit applications will fail without exception. This architectural restriction is part of Apple's platform modernization strategy. The limitation applies across all deployment scenarios and cannot be overridden through management tools or special configurations.

</div>
<div class="cause-card">

### üîÑ Legacy App Deployment
Organizations may encounter this error when attempting to deploy older applications that haven't been updated for 64-bit compatibility. Legacy enterprise applications that haven't been modernized will trigger this error. Internal apps developed before the 64-bit requirement may need rebuilding. Understanding the necessity of 64-bit compatibility is crucial for successful app deployment planning.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Assessment
Begin by verifying the application's architecture requirements and compatibility. Contact the application vendor or developer to confirm 64-bit version availability. Review application documentation for version compatibility information. Document findings and available upgrade paths for planning purposes.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Version Upgrade
If a 64-bit version is available, proceed with obtaining and deploying the updated application. Download the 64-bit compatible version from the vendor or App Store. Update deployment configurations to use the new version. Test the updated application thoroughly before broad deployment. Document the upgrade process and any configuration changes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Solutions
When 64-bit versions are unavailable, explore alternative solutions to meet business requirements. Research modern applications that provide similar functionality. Consider developing new 64-bit compatible versions of internal applications. Document chosen alternatives and implementation approaches.
