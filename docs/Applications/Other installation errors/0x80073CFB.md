## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to install a package that appears to be the same as an already installed version but is not bitwise identical. This commonly happens when a package has been rebuilt or re-signed, creating a technically different package despite having the same version number. Resolution requires either version number increment or complete removal of the existing package from all users.

<div class="cause-card">

### üì¶ Package Identity Issues
Package identity conflicts often arise from rebuild or re-signing processes. Digital signatures might differ between versions. Package contents could have minor variations. Bitwise differences prevent direct replacement. Understanding package identity requirements is crucial for successful updates.
