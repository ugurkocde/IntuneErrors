# Error 0x800705b4: Hardware Security Requirements Not Met

:::danger Error Message
Securing your hardware (Failed: 0x800705b4)
Joining your organization's network (Previous step failed)
Registering your device for mobile management (Previous step failed)
:::

## Error Details

<div class="error-details">

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Error Code (Hex) | `0x800705b4` |
| Error Code (Dec) | `-2147023436` |

</div>

## Description

:::info
This error occurs during Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode when the device doesn't meet the required hardware or software specifications. The device must have a physical TPM 2.0 chip and run a supported Windows version. Virtual TPMs (like in Hyper-V VMs) and TPM 1.2 chips are not supported.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîê TPM Requirements
Security failures often stem from TPM incompatibility. Virtual TPM not supported. TPM 1.2 insufficient for requirements. Physical TPM 2.0 chip required. Understanding hardware requirements is crucial for successful deployment.

</div>
<div class="cause-card">

### üíª Windows Version Issues
Version-related complications can prevent deployment. Windows build might be outdated. Hybrid join scenarios need newer versions. Version requirements vary by deployment type. These version factors require verification and possible updates.

</div>

## System Requirements

### TPM Requirements
- Physical TPM 2.0 chip required
- Virtual TPMs not supported
- TPM 1.2 not supported
- No exceptions available

### Windows Version Requirements
- Standard deployment:
  - Windows 10 build 1709 or later
- Microsoft Entra hybrid join:
  - Windows 10 build 1809 or later

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify TPM Status
Check TPM specifications:
1. Open TPM Management Console (tpm.msc)
2. Verify TPM version and type
3. Confirm physical TPM presence
4. Document TPM specifications

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Windows Version
Verify Windows build:
1. Open System Information
2. Check Windows version and build
3. Compare against requirements
4. Plan updates if needed

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ System Updates
If version requirements not met:
1. Backup important data
2. Download required Windows version
3. Perform system update
4. Verify new build number
