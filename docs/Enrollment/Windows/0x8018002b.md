:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### UPN Configuration Issues
Enrollment failures often stem from UPN domain problems. UPN might contain unverified domains. Non-routable domains (like .local) could be in use. Domain verification status might be incomplete. Understanding UPN requirements is crucial for successful auto-enrollment.

</div>
<div class="cause-card">

### üîí MDM Scope Configuration
Scope-related complications can prevent automatic enrollment. MDM user scope might be set to None. Group assignments could be missing or incorrect. Scope settings might not align with enrollment requirements. These configuration factors require systematic verification and correction.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Option A: Fix UPN Domain
If using unverified/non-routable domain:
1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers (dsa.msc)
2. Navigate to Users under your domain
3. For single user:
   - Right-click user > Properties
   - On Account tab, select valid UPN suffix
   - Click OK
4. For multiple users:
   - Select users > Action menu > Properties
   - On Account tab, check UPN suffix
   - Select valid suffix
   - Click OK
5. Force synchronization:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module ADSync
   Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
   ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Option B: Configure MDM Scope
If MDM scope is incorrect:
1. Sign in to Azure portal
2. Navigate to Microsoft Entra ID
3. Select Mobility (MDM and MAM)
4. Click Microsoft Intune
5. Configure MDM user scope:
   - Set to "All" for universal access
   - Or set to "Some" and select specific groups
6. Set MAM User scope to None
7. Save changes

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verification
After implementing changes:
1. Allow time for synchronization
2. Check Event Viewer for new attempts
3. Monitor Task Scheduler results
4. Verify successful enrollment

## Troubleshooting Tips

:::tip Configuration Management
When addressing auto-enrollment issues, focus on both UPN and scope settings. Verify domain routing capability. Check MDM scope configuration. Test enrollment after changes. Monitor synchronization completion.
:::

:::warning Important Considerations
Domain management involves several factors. Synchronization needs time to complete. Multiple users may need updates. Consider using Alternate Login ID if needed. Monitor enrollment success rates.
