# Error: OOBEIDPS Network Access Blocked

:::danger Error Message
Something went wrong. OOBEIDPS.
:::

## Description

:::info
This error occurs during Windows Autopilot deployment when network infrastructure blocks access to the Identity Provider (IdP). The error indicates that proxy settings, firewall rules, or other network configurations are preventing the necessary communication with authentication services.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üåê Network Access Issues
Connection failures often stem from network restrictions. Proxy servers might block authentication traffic. Firewall rules could prevent IdP access. Network security devices might interfere with connections. Understanding network requirements is crucial for successful authentication.

## Resolution Steps

<div class="steps-container">

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Network Requirements Review
Verify access to required services:
1. Check network documentation
2. Review proxy configurations
3. Examine firewall rules
4. Identify blocked endpoints

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Network Access
Ensure proper access to Autopilot services:
1. Allow required endpoints
2. Configure proxy exceptions
3. Update firewall rules
4. Enable necessary protocols

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Validation
After configuration changes:
1. Test network connectivity
2. Verify IdP access
3. Attempt Autopilot deployment
4. Monitor for successful completion
