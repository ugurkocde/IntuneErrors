## Description

:::info
This error occurs when attempting to register a device that has a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip capable of version 2.0 but is currently running an older version. The error can also appear when there are conflicting Autopilot profile assignments for the same device.
:::

## Common Causes

<div class="card-container">
<div class="cause-card">

### üîê TPM Version Issues
Registration failures often stem from TPM version mismatches. TPM chip supports 2.0 but runs older version. Version upgrade not completed. TPM configuration requires update. Understanding TPM requirements is crucial for successful registration.
